# United Arab Emirate

Starting in 2018 UAE will introduce VAT Tax.

# Requirements
The UAE Federal Tax Authority (FTA) requires accounting software to meet certain requirements. There is a set specifications for the required output:
* FTA VAT Audit File (FAF)
  It is a file that include information regarding the accounting, transactions, customers, suppliers.
* VAT return file 
  Summary information relative to the period, with amount of tax due and recoverable.
* Software publisher should go through a validation process.
* Invoice accepted format.

# Feasibility of conforming with the requirements 
Banana Accounting is a Universal Accounting software extremely versatile and already used in more the 120 countries.
Thanks to the agile development provided by BananaApps it is possible application for specific reporting, in print or file.
We have [already developed many solutions](https://www.banana.ch/doc9/en/node/9058), for Austria, China, Germany, Italy, Switzerland and othe countries.
  
Based on a first evaluation of the documents provided by the UAE FAT it should be possible to develop a BananaApps with the necessary functionality required by the UAE FTA.

# Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

In collaboration with users we would like to create an BananaApp for UAE. 
This development should then become the base for an evaluation from the FTA.

## Vaiting for the reference documentation
Currently the information made available from the Federal Tax Authority does not states exactly how companies should report VAT at the end of the period.
We need to wait for the exact form to be able to define the VAT code and the necessary report.
