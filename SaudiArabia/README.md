# Saudi Arabia

Starting in 2018 Saudi Arabia (SA) will introduce VAT Tax.

# Requirements
The SA  Tax Authority requires accounting software to meet certain requirements. There is a set specifications for the required output:
* VAT report format 
  Summary information relative to the period, with amount of tax due and recoverable.
* Invoice accepted format.

# Feasibility of conforming with the requirements 
Banana Accounting is a Universal Accounting software extremely versatile and already used in more the 120 countries.
Thanks to the agile development provided by BananaApps it is possible application for specific reporting, in print or file.
We have [already developed many solutions](https://www.banana.ch/doc9/en/node/9058), for Austria, China, Germany, Italy, Switzerland and othe countries.
  
Based on a first evaluation of the documents provided by the UAE FAT it should be possible to develop a BananaApps with the necessary functionality required by the UAE FTA.

This development should then become the base for an evaluation from the FTA.
